# hngx_first_project

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is the first project given by HNGx, I used the following libraries

Google font for the Inter font family.

Device preview to test the responsiveness of the application.

Flutter inAppWebView for webview.

I used MediaQuery for the implementation of responsiveness.

The app has only three pages, the splash screen, the main page and the Github profile page.
